## About

This repository provides code to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript "Spatial pattern analysis of line-segment data in ecology" by Yates, Luke; Brook, Barry;   Buettel, Jessie C (2021).

## Details

The series of four R scripts 00_lineSegment...R, etc. (see directory) reproduce the full set of results for the manuscript. The time-consuming computation of the summary function estimates for the Monte Carlo analyses have been saved as an R data object in the folder 'output'. Alternatively, the analyses can be re-run in their entirety.
